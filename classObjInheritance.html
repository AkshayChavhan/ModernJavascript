 In programming language we often say 'an object is an instance of a class'
 This means that ,using a class ,I can create many objects and they all share
 methods and properties.


<script>

class Student{
    constructor(name ,age , cls){
        this.myname = name;
        this.mycls = cls;
        this.myage = age;
    }

    biodata(){
        // console.log(`My name is ${this.myname} and from ${this.mycls} and 
        // age is ${this.myage}`)

        return `My name is ${this.myname} and from ${this.mycls} and 
        age is ${this.myage}`;
    }
}


class Player extends Student{
    constructor(name,age,cls,game){
        super(name,age,cls);
        this.mygame = game ;
    }

    playerBio(){
        return `${super.biodata()} . I am player of ${this.mygame}` ;
    
    }
}

let obj1 = new Student('vinod' , 26 , 'MCA');
let obj2 = new Player( 'Akshay' , 25 ,'btech','cricket')

obj1.biodata();
console.log(obj2.playerBio());
