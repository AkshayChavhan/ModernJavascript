<!-- 1 ] A closure is combination of function and lexical envornment
    within which that function is declared

2 ] Closure in action that is inner function  can have access to 
the outer function variables  AS WELL AS  the global variables.

3]  the return statement  does not execute the inner function  - function
is executed  only when followed by () ,but rather than return statement return 
the entire body of function. -->
