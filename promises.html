Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JS .
They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous
operations where callbacks can create callbacks hell leading to
unmanageable code


A Promise is an object that keep track about wheather a certin event has
happened already or not.

Determines what happens after the events has happpened.

Promise has 3 stages :
1] Pending
2] Resolved
3] Rejected

 
<script>

    const pobj1 =new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
        setTimeout(()=>{
            let roll_No = [1,2,3,4,5];
            resolve(roll_No);
            // reject("error found in promise");
        },2000);
    });

    const getBiodata = (indexdata) => {
        return new Promise((resolve,reject) =>{
            setTimeout((indexData) => {
                let biodata = {
                    name :'vinod',
                    age : 26
                }
                resolve(`My roll no. is ${indexdata}.My name is  ${biodata.name} and I am ${biodata.age} years old`);
            },2000,indexdata);
        });
    }


    pobj1.then((rollno) => {
        console.log(rollno);
        return getBiodata(rollno[1]);
    }).then((result) =>{
        console.log(result);
    })
    .catch((error) =>{
        console.log(error);
    })
